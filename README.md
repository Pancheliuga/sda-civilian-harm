#### *This project aims to extract statistical insights and produce a meaningful cartographic visualization of civilian harm in Ukraine.*

*The data for this project based on incidents in Ukraine that have resulted in potential civilian harm. This data began collection by the OSINT group [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) on February 24, 2022, and intends to be a living document that will continue to be updated as long as the war persists. Therefore, this data is not an exhaustive list of civilian harm in Ukraine but rather a representation of all incidents that Bellingcat has collected and determined the exact locations.*

All computations were made in the Jupyter notebook, and I really like Jupyter for its ability to represent your work without additional storytelling in the article.
